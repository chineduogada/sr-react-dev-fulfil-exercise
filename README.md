# Senior React Dev Fulfil.io's DataTable Assignment

## Points and Rating scheme
* Can your design handle 50K+ rows? How are you avoiding memory leaks? Can this design load data infinitely?
* Have you improved the component API to be better? How are you loading the data from the rest endpoint?
* Code quality is a very important part of the assignment. Better documented, standards compliant code that is readable
wins over brilliant hacks. Remember CPU and Memory are cheap and expendable, humans are not. How developer
friendly are props in your component?
* Clean commits and a good commit history offers a sneak peak into planning and execution.
* Is your component tested? Does it have automatic CI?
